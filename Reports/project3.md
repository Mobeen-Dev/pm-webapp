# Tailoring Justification — why these practices were selected or omitted

**1) Heavy formal governance & stage gates chosen**

* **Why**: civil/electrical works involve fixed physical interfaces and high safety/regulatory exposure — require formal stage gating and approvals before committing to next phases.
* **Standards basis**: PRINCE2 staged control (Controlling a Stage, Managing Stage Boundaries), ISO 21502 emphasis on governance and control (cl.4.3.6), PMBOK7 tailoring for complexity (§1.2; §3.3).

**2) Strong procurement and contract management stream included**

* **Why**: public procurement law, multiple large contractors and long-lead items mean procurement drives schedule and risk. Omitting this would create legal and delivery risk.
* **Standards basis**: ISO 21502 & ISO 21500 procurement guidance; PMBOK7 procurement & risk domains.

**3) Integrated technical design and configuration control**

* **Why**: multiple engineering disciplines must interoperate (civil tolerances, electrical interfaces with infrastructure, IT systems integration). Configuration management prevents scope drift and rework.
* **Standards basis**: ISO 21500 integration/quality; PRINCE2 Product-based planning and configuration; PMBOK7 Planning & Delivery.

**4) Continuous risk & independent assurance**

* **Why**: government accountability requires independent assurance and transparent risk reporting to oversight bodies. Quantitative risk analysis supports contingency and budget.
* **Standards basis**: PRINCE2 Assurance theme; PMBOK7 Risk performance domain (§3.7); ISO 21502 risk clauses.

**5) Use of some iterative/adaptive methods for IT scope only**

* **Why**: the IT components benefit from iterative delivery (rapid changes, software) while civil works need predictive control. So we **tailor** to use hybrid approach: predictive for civil/electrical, adaptive for IT — but retain unified governance and change control.
* **Standards basis**: PMBOK7 Development Approach domain (§3.3), PRINCE2 Tailoring principle (apply different approaches within same project), ISO 21502 clause on development approach.

**6) Omitted full agile transformation / pure agile end-to-end**

* **Why**: pure agile would be unsuitable for heavy civil scope, public procurement/regulatory constraints, and fixed milestone payments; however, agile techniques are retained locally for IT work under IT delivery manager.
* **Standards basis**: PMBOK7 guidance on tailoring and development approach; PRINCE2 tailoring & modular application.

**7) Extensive documentation & statutory archiving kept**

* **Why**: required for long statutory retention, audits, future maintenance and liability claims in public projects. Minimal documentation would be non-compliant.
* **Standards basis**: ISO 21500/21502 documentation and audit clauses; PRINCE2 emphasis on products and records.
