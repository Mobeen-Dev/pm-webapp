## Hybrid / Adaptive Process Model for Innovative Product Development
* **Type**: *Innovative Product Development (R&D-heavy)*
* **Context**: *High uncertainty, emergent outcomes, roughly 1-year duration*
* **Objective**: *Create a hybrid/adaptive project management process that balances structured control (predictive) with iterative learning (adaptive)*
* **Constraint**: *All sources must be traceable and grounded strictly in*

*(R&D-heavy, ~1 year, uncertain outcomes)*

---

### **Phase 1 – Initiation and Exploration**

**Purpose:** Establish vision, explore feasibility, define high-level hypotheses rather than fixed scope.
**Approach:** Adaptive initiation with progressive elaboration and stakeholder co-creation.

**Key Activities**

* Define problem/opportunity and desired outcomes (*PMBOK7 §2.2.2; ISO 21502 cl. 4.3.2*)
* Conduct preliminary feasibility and R&D exploration (*ISO 21502 cl. 4.3.2; PMBOK7 §3.3, Design Domain*)
* Identify sponsors, product owners, innovation leads (*PRINCE2 §7.2–7.3; ISO 21502 cl. 4.3.2*)
* Develop initial business case and high-level charter (*PRINCE2 §8.2; ISO 21502 cl. 4.3.2*)
* Define governance and iteration cadence (*PRINCE2 §4.1, “Tailor to the project”; PMBOK7 §3.3, “Tailoring domain”*)

**Decision Point (Gate 1)**
Confirm strategic alignment and funding for an *exploratory phase*.

**Outputs**

* Project Charter / Mandate (*PMBOK7 §3.4; PRINCE2 §8.3; ISO 21502 cl. 4.3.2*)
* Initial Business Case (*PRINCE2 §8.2; ISO 21502 cl. 4.3.2*)
* Stakeholder Map (*PMBOK7 §3.8; ISO 21502 cl. 4.3.7*)

**Roles**

* **Sponsor / Executive** – owns business case, approves exploration
* **Project Manager / Innovation Lead** – drives adaptive planning
* **Key Stakeholders** – validate needs and innovation direction

---

### **Phase 2 – Iterative Discovery and Design**

**Purpose:** Experimentation, prototyping, learning loops, and refinement of concept and feasibility.

**Key Activities**

* Plan short experimental iterations (2–4 weeks) focusing on learning outcomes (*PMBOK7 §3.3, “Development Approach Domain”*)
* Define iteration objectives, success criteria, and review points (*ISO 21502 cl. 4.3.5; PRINCE2 §12.2, “Controlling a Stage”*)

* Engage users and stakeholders in evaluation cycles (*PMBOK7 §3.8; ISO 21502 cl. 4.3.7*)
* Capture lessons and adapt plans (*PRINCE2 §4.1 “Tailor”; ISO 21502 cl. 4.3.6 “Monitor and Control”*)

**Decision Point (Gate 2)**
End-of-iteration or concept validation — decide to continue, pivot, or stop.

**Outputs**

* Prototype or research findings (*PMBOK7 §3.3; ISO 21502 cl. 4.3.5*)
* Updated business case and backlog (*PRINCE2 §8.2; ISO 21502 cl. 4.3.6*)

* **Sponsor** – validates continued business justification (*PRINCE2 §8.2*)

---

### **Phase 3 – Incremental Development and Validation**

**Purpose:** Transition from concept to functional product increments while maintaining adaptability.

**Key Activities**

* Define increment objectives and acceptance criteria (*PMBOK7 §3.3; ISO 21502 cl. 4.3.5*)
* Integrate design, build, and validation in short cycles (*PMBOK7 §3.3, “Delivery and Uncertainty Domains”*)
* Use timeboxed reviews or stage boundaries to reassess viability (*PRINCE2 §12.2; ISO 21502 cl. 4.3.6*)
* Manage risks actively through continual reassessment (*PMBOK7 §3.7; ISO 21502 cl. 4.3.9*)
* Refine stakeholder engagement strategy (*PMBOK7 §3.8; ISO 21502 cl. 4.3.10*)

* Performance reports and risk register updates (*ISO 21502 cl. 4.3.9–4.3.10*)

**Roles**

* **Project Manager** – coordinates increments, maintains integration (*PMBOK7 §3.6*)
* **R&D / Dev Team** – build, test, refine product components
* **Sponsor** – ensures continued strategic fit and resource commitment

---

### **Phase 4 – Implementation and Transition**

**Purpose:** Transition validated innovation to operations or production and evaluate benefits realization potential.

**Key Activities**

* Conduct pilot or field trials (*ISO 21502 cl. 4.3.5; PMBOK7 §3.3*)
* Evaluate outcomes against business case (*PRINCE2 §14.2 “Managing Product Delivery”; ISO 21502 cl. 4.3.6*)
* Develop handover plan and operational support readiness (*ISO 21502 cl. 4.3.7*)
* Collect performance data for lessons learned (*PMBOK7 §3.9*)

**Decision Point (Gate 4)**
Approve transition to operational ownership or next phase of scaling.

**Outputs**

* Pilot / field results and performance metrics
* Handover and transition documentation (*ISO 21502 cl. 4.3.7*)
* Updated lessons learned and closure report (*PMBOK7 §3.9; PRINCE2 §16.6*)

**Roles**

* **Project Manager** – leads transition and closure activities
* **Sponsor / Operations Lead** – accepts final results (*PRINCE2 §16.6*)
